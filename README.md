# RoomBookkeeping
**App to manage room's bookkeeping (who owns who and how much when buying smth)**

This is an app that allows you to easily calculate yours and your roommates' outcomes when you are buying a lot of stuff and
a part of it is for every one of you, something one of your roommates bought only for him/her and other part is for example for 2 people out of 3.

So, if only one person bought all of this, it becomes very hard to calculate how much money everybody needs to return to him/her. My app can help with calculating that

### Here are some screenshots of the app
